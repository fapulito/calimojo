    <h1>Privacy Policy</h1>

    <div class="typo">
      <p>Poker with Friends. ("Poker with Friends") is committed to
      protecting the privacy of its users ("users" or "you"). This
      Privacy Policy has been created to inform you about how Poker
      with Friends manages, collects, stores and uses the
      information you provide in connection with any Poker with
      Friends game or application ("Service"). Please note that the
      scope of this Privacy Policy is limited only to information
      collected by Poker with Friends through your use of a
      Service.</p>

      <p>By using the Service, you agree to the collection and use
      of your personal information as outlined in this Privacy
      Policy. Poker with Friends may amend the Privacy Policy from
      time to time, and Poker with Friends encourages you to
      consult the Privacy Policy regularly for changes.</p>

      <p>Information Collected</p>

      <p>Poker with Friends 's primary objective in collecting user
      information is to provide and enhance the Service and to
      enable users to enjoy the Service.</p>

      <p>When you install any of the Services, Poker with Friends
      may collect and record the information you provide to Poker
      with Friends, whether through the Services or through social
      network or other third party services ("Account
      Information"). Personal Information</p>

      <p>Personal information
      means information about you that can be used to contact or
      identify you. The personal information types collected in
      accordance with a Service may vary depending on the activity
      and may include:</p>

      <p>(1) Your name; (2)Your social network or third party
      service user identification number; (3) Your mobile
      device unique identifier (UDID); (4)
      Transaction identifiers for purchases; (5) Your email
      address; (6) Your profile picture; or (7) Any other relevant
      information included in your application, social network or
      other online profile.</p>

      <p>Additionally, Poker with Friends may acquire information
      from you through: (1) Your access and participation in
      message boards on a Service; (2) The contents of your
      Customer Support requests; or (3) Your purchase of a virtual
      product of any type.</p>

      <p>Please note that because a third party site manages the
      purchases of virtual goods offered by the Service, Poker with
      Friends does not have access to your credit card details or
      billing information.</p>

      <p>Non-Personal Information Non-personal
      information is information that, when taken
      alone, cannot be used to identify or contact you. Poker with
      Friends may collect non-personal information about your use
      of its Service both in the course of game play and software
      usage. Poker with Friends may also invite you to share
      non-personal information about yourself which may include but
      is not limited to: (1) Your age or date of birth; (2) Your
      gender; (3) Information about the hardware you may own; (4)
      Your favorite websites, friend information and fan pages; or
      (5) Any other information included in your application,
      social network or other online profile.</p>

      <p>If non-Personal Information is collected for an activity
      that also requires personal information, Poker with Friends
      may combine your non-personal information with your personal
      information in an attempt to provide you with a better user
      experience, to improve the value and quality of the Services
      and to analyze how its Services are used. The Service may
      also record game play information such as your game session
      duration or your high scores.</p>

      <p>In addition to information collected as described above,
      you may choose to share additional information about yourself
      throughout the Service, such as on message boards and in
      games. Any actions you perform with other players are
      considered public, and are in your sole discretion.</p>

      <p>Other information Poker with Friends may collect includes
      your occupation, language, zip code, area code, location, and
      the time zone where a Service is used, as well as information
      about your computer, mobile device, software, platform,
      incident data, Internet Protocol (IP) address, network Media
      Access Control (MAC) address and connection, browser type,
      browser language, referring pages, exit pages and URLs,
      number of clicks, domain names, landing pages, pages viewed
      and the order of those pages, the amount of time spent on
      particular pages, and the date and time of this activity, so
      that Poker with Friends can better understand customer
      behavior and improve its products, services, and advertising.
      Poker with Friends may also receive either non-personal or
      public information from third parties in connection with
      market and demographic studies and/or data that Poker with
      Friends may use to supplement personal information provided
      directly by you. Use of Your Information How Poker with
      Friends Uses Your Information</p>

      <p>Poker with Friends uses your information to fulfill your
      specific requests, purchase orders and to send you purchase
      confirmation and other account-related information. In
      addition, the personal information you provide will allow
      Poker with Friends to send you messages regarding, among
      other things, new products, features, enhancements, special
      offers, upgrade opportunities, contests and events of
      interest. You may also later opt out of certain of these
      communications.</p>

      <p>Poker with Friends may also use personal and non-personal
      information, both individually and combined together, to
      better understand the behavior and preferences of its
      customers, to troubleshoot technical problems, to serve
      static and dynamic advertising, to enforce its Terms of
      Service, to ensure proper functioning of its products and
      services as well as to help improve Services and their
      content. In addition, Poker with Friends may combine
      non-personal information with personal information, such as
      an email address, to administer loyalty programs, tailor its
      offerings, web pages or game play experience to you.</p>

      <p>By use of friend finder tools whether directly through the
      Service or through a social network or gaming service, you
      acknowledge that use of these friend finder tools will help
      you find your contacts and will also allow your contacts to
      associate your Service account (and related gaming
      entitlements, including games played, spins and coins) with
      your social networking profile and/or email address. Your
      resulting friends&trade; list will be subject to
      this privacy policy.</p>

      <p>If you choose to use a referral service to "tell a friend"
      about a Service, Poker with Friends may ask you for your
      friend name and email address. Poker
      with Friends will send your friend an email on your behalf or
      a text message inviting him or her to visit the relevant site
      or check out the Service. Poker with Friends stores your
      friend's name and email for a short period for the sole
      purpose of sending this email and for redundancy checking, to
      be sure that your friend does not receive multiple copies of
      the same email message. Poker with Friends does not keep or
      use this information for any other purpose.</p>

      <p>If you enter into a sweepstake, contest, or similar
      promotion, Poker with Friends may use the information you
      provide to administer those programs. Your participation in
      tournaments or other online game events is conditional upon
      you granting Poker with Friends permission to collect, use,
      store, transmit and display publicly statistical data, such
      as your scores, rankings and achievements, generated through
      your participation.</p>

      <p>In all cases of data access and collection, the
      information you provide will not be disclosed, rented,
      loaned, leased, sold, or otherwise voluntarily distributed to
      unaffiliated third parties and will be used solely for the
      purpose of providing you with and improving the Service and
      for any other purpose stated herein. Poker with Friends will
      retain your information for as long as your account is active
      or as needed to provide you services. If you wish to cancel
      your account or request that Poker with Friends no longer use
      your information contact Poker with Friends at the email
      address provided in the Contact Us section below. Note that
      there may be instances where Poker with Friends is legally
      required to retain your information.</p>

      <p>Access through Social Network Services or Mobile Devices
      By accessing the Service through a social network, mobile
      device or other third party platform or service or by
      connecting to such a third party network, platform or service
      via a Service, you are authorizing Poker with Friends to
      collect, store, and use in accordance with this Privacy
      Policy any and all information that you agreed the social
      network, mobile device or other third party platform could
      provide to Poker with Friends through the social
      network/mobile device/third party platform Application
      Programming Interface (API) based on your settings on the
      third party social network, mobile device or platform. Your
      agreement takes place when you connect with the third party
      network, platform or service via the Service, and/or when you
      connect with a Service, or
      accept or
      allow (or similar terms) a
      Service to access your information through a social network,
      mobile device or other third party platform or service.</p>

      <p>Poker with Friends may also collect or receive information
      about you from other Service users who choose to upload their
      email contacts. This information will be stored by Poker with
      Friends and used primarily to help you and your friends
      connect. Third Party Service Providers Poker with Friends may
      employ third party companies and individuals to facilitate
      its Services, to provide the Services on its behalf, to
      perform tasks (e.g., without limitation, maintenance
      services, database management, web analytics and improvement
      of the Services) or to assist Poker with Friends in analyzing
      how its Services are used.</p>

      <p>From time to time, Poker with Friends employs third party
      contractors to collect personal information on its behalf to
      provide email delivery, product, prize or promotional
      fulfillment, contest administration, credit card processing
      or other services through the Service. When requesting these
      services, you may be asked to supply your name, mailing
      address, telephone number and email address to its
      contractors. Poker with Friends may ask some third party
      contractors, such as credit agencies, data analytics or
      market research firms, to supplement personal information
      that you provide to Poker with Friends for its own marketing
      and demographic studies, so that Poker with Friends can
      consistently improve its sites and related advertising to
      better meet its visitors' needs and preferences. To enrich
      its understanding of individual customers, Poker with Friends
      may tie this information to the information you provide to
      it.</p>

      information you post and communicate through a Service or a
      third party site or service is public information for which
      you have no expectation of privacy.</p>

      profiles for public view or
      in similar forums on its sites through mobile services and/or
      through third party sites or services. Information that you
      disclose in any of these forums is public information, and
      there is no expectation of privacy or confidentiality.</p>

      <p>You should be aware that any personally identifiable
      information you submit in the course of these public
      activities can be read, collected, or used by other users of

      <p>Disclosure of Your Personal Information You understand and
      agree that Poker with Friends may be required to disclose any
      personal information if required to do so by law or in the
      belief that such disclosure is reasonably necessary to avoid
      liability, to comply with legal process, including, but not
      limited to a subpoena, statute, search warrant, or court
      order, or to protect the property and rights of Poker with
      Friends or a third party, to protect the safety of the public
      or any person, or to prevent or stop activity Poker with
      Friends may consider to be, or to pose a risk of being,
      illegal, unethical or legally actionable. Note that Poker

      validity of any search warrant, subpoena or other similar
      governmental request that it may receive.</p>

      <p>Poker with Friends may also disclose information about you
      if it determines that such disclosure is reasonably necessary
      to enforce the terms and conditions of the Service or to
      protect its operations or users. Additionally, Poker with
      Friends may sell, transfer or otherwise share some or all of
      its assets, including your Personal Information, in
      connection with a merger, acquisition, reorganization or sale

      <p>Cookies Like many websites, Poker with Friends may use
      "cookies" to collect information. A cookie is a small data
      file that is transferred to your
      computer hard disk or your mobile device
      for record-keeping purposes. The Service may send cookies to
      a computer or a mobile device when a user accesses or views a
      Service. Information contained in a cookie may be linked to
      personal information for purposes such as improving the
      quality of Poker with Friends service,
      tailoring recommendations to interests, and making the
      Service easier to use. Third party advertisers on the
      Services may also place or read cookies on your browser.
      Cookies can be disabled at any time by changing your web
      browser options to stop accepting
      cookies or to prompt you before accepting a cookie from the
      websites you visit. If you do not accept cookies, however,
      you may not be able to use all portions or functionalities of
      a Service.</p>

      <p>Links The Service may contain links to other websites or
      applications. The fact that the Service links to a website or
      application or presents a banner ad or other type of
      advertisement does not mean that Poker with Friends endorses
      or authorizes that third party, nor is it a representation of
      any affiliation with that third party. If you click on a link
      to a third party site or application, including on an
      advertisement, you will leave the Poker with Friends site you
      are visiting or application you are running and will go to
      the site or application linked to. These third party websites
      and applications may place their own cookies or other files
      on your computer or mobile device, and may collect data or
      solicit personal information from you. Other sites and
      applications follow different rules regarding the use or
      disclosure of the personal information you submit to them.
      Because Poker with Friends cannot control the activities of
      third parties, it cannot accept responsibility for any use of
      your personal information by such third parties, and it
      cannot guarantee that they will adhere to the same privacy
      and security practices as Poker with Friends. You are
      therefore encouraged to read the privacy policies or
      statements of other websites and applications you visit
      before providing any personal information.</p>

      <p>Changing or Deleting Your Information You may review,
      update, correct or delete any personal information by
      changing the applicable information in your profile page. If
      you completely delete all of this information, your account
      may be deactivated. If you would like Poker with Friends to
      delete your record in its system, please contact Poker with
      Friends and it will attempt to accommodate your request if it
      is not legally obligated to retain the record.</p>

      <p>If you have granted Poker with Friends access to your
      Account Information through a Service, you may request that
      Poker with Friends delete your Account Information by
      following the directions available at

      request deletion of your Account Information by dissociating
      or removing the Poker with Friends application from your
      social network or third party service account in accordance
      with the instructions provided by the social network or third
      party service.</p>

      <p>Security Poker with Friends has made reasonable technical
      and organizational measures designed to secure your personal
      information from accidental loss and from unauthorized
      access, use, alteration or disclosure. However, Poker with
      Friends cannot guarantee that unauthorized third parties will
      never be able to overcome those measures or use your personal
      information for improper purposes. Also please note that
      email and messaging systems are not considered secure, so
      Poker with Friends discourages you from sending Poker with
      Friends personal information through these media.</p>
